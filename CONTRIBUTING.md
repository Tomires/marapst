# Before contributing

Fork the repo, now it's yours.

## Issues, bugs

Let's be honest, I don't have enough time to manage this project. If you find a
bug in the app, try to find the time and fix it.

If you don't have the time, you can still create an issue, but don't be mad
if it's going to be ignored.

## Improvements, enhancements

Unless you're absolutely sure you're making an useful feature that will be
accepted, make an issue first, so your work isn't a waste of time.

# After contributing

Make a pull request. Simple.
